It's my pleasure to announce the release of **mostir v1.0.0** ðŸŽ‰

What started as a small helper around esbuild to streamline my own workflow has now grown into a standalone developer tool. With mostir, you can:

- ðŸ“¦ **Keep modules clean** â€“ zero-bundle builds with native esbuild
- âš¡ **Use glob patterns** â€“ `src/**/*.ts` works out of the box
- ðŸ”„ **Sync instantly** â€“ mirror `src` to `outdir` and remove orphan files
- ðŸ§¹ **Clean fast** â€“ wipe your dist directory in one command
- ðŸ”§ **Configure easily** â€“ manage builds with `mostir.config.mjs`
- ðŸ›  **Stay flexible** â€“ forward any esbuild option, no lock-in

This tool has already helped me in my daily work, and I hope it can help you too.  

ðŸ‘‰ Check out the [docs](/docs/getting-started) to get started, or install directly with:

```bash
pnpm add mostir -D
```

Thanks for trying it out â€” feedback and contributions are always welcome!
